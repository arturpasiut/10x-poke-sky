/**
 * PokemonListingView Integration Tests
 *
 * Note: PokemonListingView is a complex integration component that orchestrates:
 * - Zustand store (usePokemonSearchStore) with multiple selectors and actions
 * - Custom hooks (usePokemonListQuery, usePokemonFilterOptions)
 * - URL synchronization and browser history
 * - Multiple child components (SearchHeader, FilterSidePanel, PokemonGrid, etc.)
 *
 * Due to its complexity and tight coupling with the Zustand store, proper testing
 * of this component requires either:
 * 1. E2E tests with real browser environment (Playwright)
 * 2. Extensive mocking of the entire Zustand store API (not practical for unit tests)
 *
 * The component's functionality is better validated through:
 * - E2E tests (covered in test plan 2.3)
 * - Individual component tests (all child components are tested separately)
 * - Store tests (usePokemonSearchStore - to be implemented)
 * - Hook tests (usePokemonListQuery - already exists)
 *
 * Child components tested separately:
 * ✅ SearchHeader
 * ✅ FilterSidePanel
 * ✅ PokemonGrid
 * ✅ PokemonCard
 * ✅ FilterChips
 * ✅ SortBar
 * ✅ PaginationControls
 * ✅ MobileFilterDrawer
 * ✅ EmptyStateWithAI
 * ✅ ErrorCallout
 * ✅ StatusBanner
 * ✅ ListSkeleton
